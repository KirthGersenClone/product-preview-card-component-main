## My second experience with Frontend Mentor and Github

I am still figuring out how to publish my solutions to the Frontend Mentor site / Github.

## Product-preview-card

When I did the first excercise, I was having diffictulty with stacking a picture upon a text.
But when I copied the Josh Comeau CSS-reset, it worked wonders.

## New things I experimented with

So one of the things I wanted to learn doing this excercise was CSS custom properties.
So with the help of the MDN website and by reading the article "Using CSS custom properties (variables)"
I gave my colours and fonts a variable name.

Another interesting feature was to change the picture on the page when hitting a certain width.
So I came in contact with media query, and yet again I consulted the MDN website.

As for the SVG on the button I changed the code dirtectly in the HTML. Because that is how I
know to do it at this moment.
